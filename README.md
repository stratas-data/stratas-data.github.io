### Stratas Data specializes in the following Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities:
- ### Data Analysis and Visualization:
    - Stratas Data helps you make informed decisions by turning complex information into clear, actionable insights, making it easier to understand trends, identify opportunities, and take confident action
    ![Net Profit](Steakhouse_Sales_Report/netprofit.png)
    In this example, a restaurant owner is able to see the absolute and relative net profit of each menu item over two years; this is one example of several analyses and visualizations that can be incorporated into a wider data dashboard. This analysis allows the restaurant owner to make informed decisions about the menu.

- ### Time Series Analysis:
    - Stratas Data helps you forecast future trends by examining how data changes over time, enabling more accurate planning for seasonal shifts, demand fluctuations, and long-term growth

    In this example, an e-commerce site owner is able see scientifically predicted search trends for his business. Beginning at the top, the predicted range of search trends is shown on the right side of "2020-10." Second from the top, predicted search trends by day-of-week are shown. Second from the bottom, predicted search trends by day-of-year are shown. At the bottom, predicted search trends by hour-of-day are shown. These scientific predictions allow the e-commerce site owner to plan ahead with the knowledge of when the site will be most and least popular.

- ### Reinforcement Learning (RL):
    - Stratas Data enables you to optimize decision-making by allowing systems to learn from trial and error, continuously improving processes like pricing strategies, resource allocation, and customer interactions through real-time feedback

    In this example, the email data of a company is used to train a model as to when is the best time to send a promotional email based on how many clicks emails have generated. A model can also 'learn' in real-time by using APIs to continually update its weights based on incoming data. This model allows you to be confident automated promotional emails are being sent out at the optimal time all the time.

- ### Deep Learning (DL):
    - Stratas Data uses Neural Networks (NNs) to equip you to model complex relationships in data, enabling advanced applications like pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and automation in decision-making processes
    - Stratas Data uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to take this further by helping you to create realistic synthetic data, such as images or text, which can be used for tasks like enhancing product design, improving marketing content, or augmenting training data for further improving automated processes
- ### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
    - Used by Stratas Data and powered by advanced DL models like Transformers, NLP lets you understand and process human language at scale, enabling applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and personalized marketing, improving both efficiency and customer experiences
