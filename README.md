# Capabilities
### Stratas Data specializes in the following Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities:
- ### Data Analysis and Visualization:
    - Helps you make informed decisions by turning complex information into clear, actionable insights, making it easier to understand trends, identify opportunities, and take confident action
- ### Time Series Analysis:
    - Allows you to forecast future trends by examining how data changes over time, enabling more accurate planning for seasonal shifts, demand fluctuations, and long-term growth
- ### Reinforcement Learning (RL):
    - Enables you to optimize decision-making by allowing systems to learn from trial and error, continuously improving processes like pricing strategies, resource allocation, and customer interactions through real-time feedback
- ### Deep Learning (DL):
    - Neural Networks (NNs) equip you to model complex relationships in data, enabling advanced applications like pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and automation in decision-making processes
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) take this further by helping you to create realistic synthetic data, such as images or text, which can be used for tasks like enhancing product design, improving marketing content, or augmenting training data for further improving automated processes
- ### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
    - Powered by advanced DL models like Transformers, lets you understand and process human language at scale, enabling applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and personalized marketing, improving both efficiency and customer experiences
